In this assignment, we are using aa null phyothesis. Then, we try to show the effectiveness of B is better than A.

We use a matched pair experiment in which the same set of queries is being used in both retrieval algorithms.

A significance test (or specifically: t-test) will be used in order to reject the null hypothesis. We assume that the P-value should be smaller than #alpha which is 0.05/0.1[decide later].
